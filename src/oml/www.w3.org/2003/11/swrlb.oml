    @rdfs:comment  "Satisfied iff the first argument and the second argument are both in some implemented type and the first argument is less than the second argument according to a type-specific ordering (partial or total), if there is one defined for the type.

If the numerator is not evenly divided by the divisor, then the quotient is the xsd:integer value obtained, ignoring any remainder that results from the division (that is, no rounding is performed)."
    builtin integerDivide
    
    @rdfs:comment "Satisfied if the first argument represents the remainder resulting from dividing the second argument, the dividend, by the third argument, the divisor. The operation a mod b for operands that are xsd:integer or xsd:decimal, or types derived from them, produces a result such that (a idiv b)*b+(a mod b) is equal to a and the magnitude of the result is always less than the magnitude of b. This identity holds even in the special case that the dividend is the negative integer of largest possible magnitude for its type and the divisor is -1 (the remainder is 0). It follows from this rule that the sign of the result is the sign of the dividend"
