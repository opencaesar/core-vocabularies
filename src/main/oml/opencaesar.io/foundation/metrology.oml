@dc:description "The Metology vocabulary defines the concepts of metrology according to VIM3.
See https://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/index.html
See https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2012.pdf

VIM3 was the basis for the updated SysML v1 QUDV library.
VIM3 is also the basis for the revised SysML v2 QUDV library currently developed by the SysML v2 SST;
which is also the basis of the present OML QUDV vocabulary.

The objective is to align this OML QUDV library with the SysMLv2 QUDV library 
such that their respective semantics become interoperable in a practically meaningful way.
That is, the goal is to achieve a level of semantic compatibility such that
the representation of metrology in OML or in SysMLv2 becomes a difference of concrete syntax representation
(i.e, in OML or in Alf) with an equivalent logical semantics in OWL2 DL + SWRL and in SysMLv2's logical semantics."

    Note: The SysML 1.4 QUDV library is sufficiently expressive to cover VIM3 chapter 1
    (See: http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?syseng/2014-03-08). Even though the QUDV constructs
    are definied as SysML Blocks, the modeling in OML involves different kinds of constructs, including
    OML concepts and relation entities. Those QUDV constructs that map to OML Concepts are defined
    as specializations of mbase:MetrologicalEntity."

    Note: The representation of the numerical quantity value is deliberately left open to be specified in library extensions.
    This strategy provides ample latitude for choosing suitable datatypes for representing a numerical quantity value
    optionally with additional information such as measurement precision [VIM3-2.15].
